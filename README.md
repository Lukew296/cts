# AuthApp: Simple Authentication and Dashboard UI

## Project Description
AuthApp is a basic web application demonstrating a user authentication flow (login and registration) and a simple dashboard interface. It's built using plain HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript, making it a lightweight and easy-to-understand example for front-end development.

## Features
*   **User Login Page:** A clean and responsive form for user authentication.
*   **User Registration Page:** A form for new user sign-ups with basic client-side validation.
*   **Dashboard Page:** A responsive dashboard layout featuring a header, a collapsible sidebar, and example content cards.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Modern and utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **Client-Side JavaScript:** Basic interactivity, including form validation and sidebar toggling.

## Technologies Used
*   **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For client-side logic and interactivity.
